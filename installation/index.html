            <p>The Ghost documentation is very much a work in progress, it is updated and improved regularly. If you get stuck or have suggestions for improvements, let us know.</p>

            <p>Ghost is built on <a href="http:://nodejs.org">Node</a>, and requires version <code>0.10.*</code> (latest stable version).</p>

            <p>Running Ghost locally on your computer is straight forward, but requires that you install Node.js first.</p>
