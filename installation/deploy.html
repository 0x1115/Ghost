            <p>So you're ready to get Ghost live? Excellent!</p>

            <p>You're going to need a hosting package that already has, or will allow you to install Node.js. This means something like a cloud (Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean), VPS (Webfaction, Dreamhost) or other package that has SSH (terminal) access & will allow you to install Node. There are plenty around and they can be very cheap.</p>

            <p>What won't work at the moment, is cPanel-style shared hosting as this is usually aimed specifically at hosting PHP. Although some offer Ruby, and so may offer Node in the future as they are somewhat similar.

            <p>Additionally, several of the Node-specific cloud hosting solutions such as Nodejitsu & Heroku will work at first, but they will delete your files and therefore all image uploads and your database will disappear. Heroku supports MySQL so you could use this, but you will still lose any uploaded images.</p>
